## Describing the Dataset and What it Contains:
The dataset that we selected contains the average price of electricity from the years 1993-2019. It is organized by the type of customer being serviced (Commercial, Industrial, Residential, Transportation, Other), the Industry Sector (Total Electric Industry) and this data is included for each US state for each of the years present. This data set can be useful in a variety of ways. For consumers, the data can be used to understand how electricity prices have fluctuated over time and how these changes have affected households and businesses. This information can be valuable for advocating for consumer rights, promoting affordability initiatives, and fostering energy conservation efforts. In addition, it can be useful to researchers and policy makers in the sense that industry analysts can use the data to identify long-term trends in electricity prices across states. Understanding how prices have evolved over time can provide insights into factors such as changes in energy production, consumption patterns, regulatory policies, and economic conditions. From this, policy makers can assess the effectiveness of past energy policies by examining how electricity prices have changed over the years. This information can help policymakers make data-driven decisions when designing new policies or refining existing ones.


## Two Team Generated Questions and Why They are Interesting/ Important:
1. What is the average electricity price by state for all customers (residential, transportation, commercial, industrial) 
This would be interesting/important because it provides a comprehensive view of the overall cost of electricity in different regions. Analyzing this data can reveal disparities in pricing across states, which can be influenced by factors such as energy source mix, regulatory policies, infrastructure investments, and demand patterns. 

2. What does the average price of electricity look like for residential electricity users in Georgia in 2027? 
Forecasting the prices of electricity for residential consumers in Georgia can be important for many reasons. First, Georgia's average residential electricity price compared to neighboring states or national averages can influence its competitiveness in attracting residents, businesses, and industries. Lower electricity prices may make the state more attractive for relocation or investment. Additionally, residential electricity prices directly impact households' budgets. Knowing the average price of electricity in Georgia allows residents to anticipate and plan for their energy expenses, helping them make informed financial decisions. This information is especially relevant to peers our age scouting out potential job locations/places to live post-graduation.
